Today, I am going to demonstrate a simple way to check if the current executing user has a writing permission for a directory in the Windows file system. I came across this issue in a project when I needed to write a utility program that would do the following: 

**Output a list of all directories that the current user is NOT able to write to.**

## Background

Microsoft provides an API for manipulating or viewing security access permission via the [System.Security.AccessControl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.accesscontrol?view=netframework-4.8)</a> namespace. However, using the ```AccessControl``` based solution, requires computing the effective permissions for the user identity running your code. It might not be an easy task, as it involves fetching a security descriptor, an access token, and properly calculating the effective permissions.

As a general solution approach, I am going to try to write a file in a specific directory without any permissions calculations. In case an exception is raised by the operating system, I am going to properly handle it and assume the directory is not writable.

## My Stack

  * Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (16.5.1)
  * .NET Framework 4.7.2 (C#) - 32/64 bit.
  * Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 18363) (18362.19h1_release.190318-1202)

## Implementation

### Setting up the pInvoke imports

* So as a first step, I am going to create a utility static class DirectoryUtils that will include the implementation.
* As I am going to use several Win32 API functions in the sample, so let's import the following: 
  - [CreateFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea)
  - [SetFileTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime)

Note: When importing a Win32 API function into a .NET project, you need to generate the pInvoke signature. For such an operation, I highly recommend you use [pinvoke.net](https://www.pinvoke.net).

```C#
public static class DirectoryUtils
{
  [DllImport("kernel32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode, SetLastError = true)]
  private static extern SafeFileHandle CreateFile(
      string fileName,
      uint dwDesiredAccess,
      FileShare dwShareMode,
      IntPtr securityAttrs_MustBeZero,
      FileMode dwCreationDisposition,
      uint dwFlagsAndAttributes,
      IntPtr hTemplateFile_MustBeZero);

  [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true, EntryPoint = "SetFileTime", ExactSpelling = true)]
  private static extern bool SetFileTime(
      SafeFileHandle hFile,
      IntPtr lpCreationTimeUnused,
      IntPtr lpLastAccessTimeUnused,
      ref long lpLastWriteTime);

  private const uint FILE_ACCESS_GENERIC_READ = 0x80000000;
  private const uint FILE_ACCESS_GENERIC_WRITE = 0x40000000;

  private const int FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS = 0x02000000;
  private const int OPEN_EXISTING = 3;
}
```

### Implementing the class

1. In the ```DirectoryUtils``` class, create a static function ```DirectoryUtils.IsWritable``` that gets a directory path to check and returns bool.
2. We need to create the temporary file using C# ```File.Create``` with a random generated file name. Note the ```FileOptions.DeleteOnClose``` flag, which ensures the file is deleted once we go out of the using scope.
3. If the code below throws an exception, we assume the directory is not writable:

```C#
using (File.Create(Path.Combine(dirPath, Path.GetRandomFileName()), 1, FileOptions.DeleteOnClose))
{

}
```
    
So far it looks very easy, but there is a small catch. If the directory is writable, its last write time will change every time we call ```DirectoryUtils.IsWritable```, since we are creating a temporary file. This might look very ugly and unprofessional, especially if we are traversing a long directory tree. All directories willÂ have the 'Date modified' changed in Windows Explorer as shown in the picture:

{{<figure width="300" height="97" class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windows-explorer-300x97.png" caption="Windows File Explorer">}}

The solution is the following:

1. Save the write time before creating the temporary file by using ```Directory.GetLastWriteTimeUtc```.
2. Restore the write time after the temporary file is deleted by using ```SetFileTime``` Win32 API.
    
```C#
public static bool SetDirectoryLastWriteUtc(string dirPath, DateTime lastWriteDate)
{
  using (var hDir = CreateFile(dirPath, FILE_ACCESS_GENERIC_READ | FILE_ACCESS_GENERIC_WRITE,
    FileShare.ReadWrite, IntPtr.Zero, (FileMode) OPEN_EXISTING,
    FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS, IntPtr.Zero))
  {
    // put back to the date before checking.
    var lastWriteTime = lastWriteDate.ToFileTime();
    if (!SetFileTime(hDir, IntPtr.Zero, IntPtr.Zero, ref lastWriteTime))
    {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

public static bool IsWritable(string dirPath)
{
  try
  {
    // Since there is a temp file that is being created,
    // this will change the modified date of the directory.
    // So if we have successful write operation, we need to
    // revert the last write date.
    var lastWriteDate = Directory.GetLastWriteTimeUtc(dirPath);

    // if this fails -> it raises an exception.
    using (File.Create(Path.Combine(dirPath, Path.GetRandomFileName()), 1, FileOptions.DeleteOnClose))
    {
    }

    try
    {
      SetDirectoryLastWriteUtc(dirPath, lastWriteDate);
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
      // add some log.
    }

    return true;
  }
  catch (UnauthorizedAccessException)
  {
     // add some log.
  }
  catch (Exception)
  {
    // add some log.
  }

  return false;
}
```
    
## Testing

Running some tests on a development machine:

1. Positive result: I used ```Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData)```. In most cases, this directory is writable for the current non-admin user. Check that the last write date did not change after the function returned a &#8216;true' value.
2. Negative result: If you are running the Visual Studio as a non-elevated process, the function should fail if you check the ```Environment.SystemDirectory```.
    
```C#
var dir = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData);
var result = DirectoryUtils.IsWritable(dir);
Console.Write($"{dir} - result={result}");

dir = Environment.SystemDirectory;
result = DirectoryUtils.IsWritable(dir);
Console.Write($"{dir} - result={result}");
```
